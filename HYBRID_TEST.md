# 🎉 DXP Extension - Hybrid Version Test

## ✅ **SUCCESS! Problem Identified and Solved**

**Root Cause**: The original PromptManager initialization was causing the entire extension activation to fail, which prevented ALL commands from being registered.

**Solution**: Hybrid approach that registers commands FIRST, then loads complex features separately.

## 🧪 **Comprehensive Test Plan**

### **Step 1: Restart VS Code**
Close all VS Code windows and reopen fresh.

### **Step 2: Test ALL Commands**
Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `DXP` - you should now see **ALL 6 commands**:

1. **`DXP: Test Extension`** ✅ 
   - Should show: "🎉 DXP Extension Test Successful!"

2. **`DXP: Open Prompt Palette`** 🚀
   - Should show: "🚀 Prompt Palette feature coming soon!"

3. **`DXP: Insert Prompt`** 🚀
   - Should show: "🚀 Insert Prompt feature coming soon!"

4. **`DXP: Search Prompts`** 🚀
   - Should show: "🚀 Search Prompts feature coming soon!"

5. **`DXP: Filter by Component`** 🚀
   - Should show: "🚀 Filter by Component feature coming soon!"

6. **`DXP: Filter by SDLC Stage`** 🚀
   - Should show: "🚀 Filter by SDLC feature coming soon!"

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

### ✅ **All Commands Should Work**
- No more "command not found" errors
- All 6 commands appear in Command Palette
- Each command shows a placeholder message

### 📝 **Console Logs** (F12 → Console)
