# 🎯 Testing Gradual Build Version

## ✅ **Progress So Far:**
- ✅ **Ultra Minimal Version**: WORKED! ("DXP Ultra Minimal Test Works!")
- 🧪 **Gradual Build Version**: Now testing...

## 🧪 **Test Plan for Gradual Build**

This version includes:
- ✅ Test command (we know this works)
- 🧪 All 6 commands (no PromptManager - just simple message responses)
- 🔍 Verification logging

### **Step 1: Restart VS Code**
Close all VS Code windows and reopen fresh.

### **Step 2: Test ALL Commands**
Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `DXP` - you should now see **ALL 6 commands**:

1. **`DXP: Test Extension`** 
   - Expected: "✅ DXP Test Works! (Gradual Build Version)"

2. **`DXP: Open Prompt Palette`**
   - Expected: "🎯 Prompt Palette - Gradual Build Version"

3. **`DXP: Insert Prompt`**
   - Expected: "🎯 Insert Prompt - Gradual Build Version"

4. **`DXP: Search Prompts`**
   - Expected: "🎯 Search Prompts - Gradual Build Version"

5. **`DXP: Filter by Component`**
   - Expected: "🎯 Filter by Component - Gradual Build Version"

6. **`DXP: Filter by SDLC Stage`**
   - Expected: "🎯 Filter by SDLC - Gradual Build Version"

### **Step 3: Check Success Message**
After activation, you should see:
"🎉 All 6 DXP commands registered successfully!"

## 🔍 **What This Test Tells Us:**

### ✅ **If All 6 Commands Work:**
- Multiple command registration is fine
- The issue is specifically with PromptManager integration
- We can proceed to add PromptManager carefully

### ❌ **If Any Command Fails:**
- We've found the exact point where the issue occurs
- Can isolate which specific command or registration pattern causes problems

## 📋 **Please Test Now:**

1. **Restart VS Code completely**
2. **Test all 6 DXP commands**
3. **Report results:**
   - Do all commands appear in Command Palette?
   - Do they all execute without "command not found" errors?
   - What messages do you see?

This gradual approach will pinpoint exactly where the issue occurs!
