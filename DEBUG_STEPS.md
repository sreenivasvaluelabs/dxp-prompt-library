# 🚨 CRITICAL DEBUGGING STEPS

The issue persists even with our ultra-minimal version. This suggests a deeper problem with either:
1. VS Code extension system caching
2. Extension activation timing
3. Command registration synchronization

## 🔍 **Immediate Diagnostic Steps**

### **Step 1: Complete VS Code Reset**
```powershell
# Close ALL VS Code windows
# Then run:
code --disable-extensions
```
This opens VS Code with ALL extensions disabled to test if there's a conflict.

### **Step 2: Check Extension Activation**
1. Open VS Code
2. Press `F12` (Developer Tools)
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Look for these messages:
   ```
   🚀 DXP Extension - ULTRA MINIMAL ACTIVATING
   🔍 Test command registered, verifying...
   Command found: true/false
   ```

### **Step 3: Manual Command Check**
In VS Code Console (F12), run:
```javascript
vscode.commands.getCommands(true).then(cmds => {
    const dxp = cmds.filter(c => c.includes('dxp'));
    console.log('DXP Commands:', dxp);
});
```

## 🎯 **Possible Issues and Solutions**

### **Issue A: Extension Not Activating**
- Check: Extension appears in Extensions panel (Ctrl+Shift+X)
- Check: Extension shows as "activated" 
- Solution: Force activation with `onStartupFinished` or `*`

### **Issue B: Command Registration Timing**
- The extension activates but commands register after VS Code tries to find them
- Solution: Use synchronous registration or immediate activation

### **Issue C: VS Code Cache Corruption**
- VS Code is using old cached extension data
- Solution: Clear VS Code extension cache

## 🛠️ **Emergency Fix: Try Different Command Name**

Let me create a version with a completely different command name to test if there's something specific about "dxpPromptLibrary.test":

```typescript
// Try: "dxpTest.simple" instead of "dxpPromptLibrary.test"
vscode.commands.registerCommand('dxpTest.simple', () => {
    vscode.window.showInformationMessage('Simple test works!');
});
```

## 📋 **Next Actions**

1. **Test with disabled extensions first**
2. **Check console logs for activation**  
3. **Try the manual command check**
4. **Report what you see in each step**

This will help us identify if it's:
- Extension conflict
- Activation timing
- Command registration issue
- VS Code system problem
